### 2) Why this cluster groups together

- **Structural Analysis**: The compounds in this cluster are characterized by the T'-phase structure of the R2CuO4 type, where R is a rare earth element typically Nd, La, or a combination with other rare earths. These structures feature quasi-2D CuO2 planes separated by rare earth oxide layers. The presence of CuO2 planes is a hallmark of cuprate superconductors, promoting 2D electronic properties crucial for high-temperature superconductivity.

- **Chemical Bonding**: The bonding within this cluster is predominantly ionic-covalent, with strong Cu-O covalent bonds in the CuO2 planes. These planes are primarily responsible for the superconducting properties due to their conducting nature, while the rare earth layers serve as charge reservoirs.

- **Electronic Structure**: The electron-doped character is defined by the replacement of Nd or analogs with Ce, which introduces additional electrons into the CuO2 planes. This electron doping influences the Fermi surface and facilitates n-type conduction. Carrier types are primarily electrons, in contrast to hole-doped YBCO-like systems.

- **Compositional Patterns**: Most compounds follow a stoichiometric pattern close to (R,Ce)2CuO4, with subtle changes introduced via substitution at either the R-site or minor variations in oxygen content. The primary compositional driver is aliovalent substitution, which maintains a contiguous electronic phase conducive to superconductivity.

- **Physical Property Correlations**: Higher Tc values are correlated with careful control of the stoichiometry, particularly the oxygen content, which can drastically affect the carrier concentration. Optimal doping and proper annealing are critical for achieving maximum Tc in these electron-doped systems.

- **Mechanistic Hypothesis**: The superconducting mechanism here likely involves unconventional superconductivity mediated by antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations in the CuO2 planes, consistent with observations in both electron- and hole-doped cuprates. The continued debate surrounding the precise pairing symmetry (e.g., s±, d-wave) aligns with established theories for these materials.

### 3) Doping analysis

- **Parent Compounds**: The main parent system of this cluster is Nd2CuO4, with Ce as the primary dopant at the Nd sites.
  
- **Tc Trends**: Electron doping (with Ce) raises Tc to a peak value. The presence of La and other rare-earth substitutions fine-tunes the carrier concentration and influences the optimal doping level.
  
- **Optimal Doping**: Tc peaks when the Ce doping is around x=0.15 for (Rn-xCex)2CuO4 systems. Over-doping or changes in the rare-earth composition past this level generally reduce Tc.
  
- **Doping Ratio Effects**: Doping at the Nd site with Ce produces a non-monotonic Tc curve, peaking around a precise electron doping concentration (e.g., x~0.15).

- **Dominant Doping**: Electron doping via Ce is the dominant mechanism here, influencing the optimal ranges and the observed superconducting properties.

- **Under/Overdoping**: Observed doping effects show under-doped systems below x=0.15 with lower Tc, while over-doped systems show a decrease in superconductivity efficacy.

### 4) Design hints

- **New Candidate Exploration**: Consider exploring mixed rare earth systems with systematic variations of co-dopants like La, Sm, and Gd to fine-tune the electronic balance. In addition, partial substitution of O with F can further enhance doping effects. Investigate controlled atmospheric processing to optimize Tc.
  
- **Substitution Strategies**: Utilize small incremental substitutions on the CuO2 planes, such as slight variations in Mn/V or other transition metals, which may adjust local electronic density and bandwidth favorably.

- **Measurement and Analysis**: Ensure precise control of oxidation states through advanced annealing processes to alter the oxygen content delicately, aligning with paths shown successful for existing high-Tc materials.
